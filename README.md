## Introduction
  If I were to give you a simple math problem, say "What is 0.1 + 0.2?", you would be able to solve it with no issues, responding with "0.3, of course". Clearly, that is the correct answer, right? This follows the basic math principles that we humans have learned and followed for our entire existence. To avoid existential crisis, yes, 0.3 is the correct answer, but arriving at that conclusion is often taken for granted, especially when we are referring to computers, which operate in an entirely different mathematical manner than we do. 

### Let's start with what we are used to - Human Numbers

Humans operate on base-10, or the decimal system. This means that numbers can have integer values ranging from 1-9, and the position of that number is based on powers of 10. Each number position moving from right to left is 10 times the position to its right. Digits to the left of the decimal are representative of values greater than or equal to 1, while values to the right are representative of values less that 1. This gives us the system that we use every day.

In this system, adding is done exactly how we are used to. If we were given an addition problem such as:
<div align="center">

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|   | 2 | 5 | 1 |
| + | 4 | 6 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
|   | 7 | 1 | 4 |
</div>
we are always taught to "carry the one". This refers to the fact that the addition taking place in a specific column runs out of integers 1-9, and must pass a value of 1 to the next column to the left, meaning a "movement up" in order of magnitude. The process for subtraction is also very similar in base-10
