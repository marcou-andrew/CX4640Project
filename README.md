## Introduction
  If I were to give you a simple math problem, say "What is 0.1 + 0.2?", you would be able to solve it with no issues, responding with "0.3, of course". Clearly, that is the correct answer, right? This follows the basic math principles that we humans have learned and followed for our entire existence. To avoid existential crisis, yes, 0.3 is the correct answer, but arriving at that conclusion is often taken for granted, especially when we are referring to computers, which operate in an entirely different mathematical manner than we do. 

### What we are used to - Human Math

Humans operate on the base-10, or decimal, system. This means that numbers can have integer values ranging from 1-9, and the position of that number is based on powers of 10. Each number position moving from right to left is 10 times the position to its right. This gives us the system that we use every day.
